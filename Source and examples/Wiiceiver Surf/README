Wiiceiver Surf Chuck + Wiiceiver Surf Board is a new *pair* of things.

The Chuck is a gutted / modified Nintendo Nunchuck w/ NRF24L01+ radio; 
it can run for hours on a small LiPo battery and has better range than
the Nyko Kama wireless.

The Board is an updated "Wiiceiver" with the NRF24L01+ radio hookup, 
but no traditional nunchuck port.

Board-side functionality is similar to the traditional Wiiceiver.
Over time I will add:
- voltage sensing on the Board / display to Chuck (red/green/yellow 
  lights to indicate battery remaining)
- integrated battery control: press a button on the Board to start it,
  use the Chuck power button to shut it down.
- pairing / syncing between up to 100 Chucks & 100 Boards

The fun thing about this setup: it doesn't depend on the Nintendo
Nunchuck; it can be easily integrated into any analog controller.
